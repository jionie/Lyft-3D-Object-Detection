# FRAMEQL, a Video analytic language
Building grammar for video analytics 
This repository has 2 main components; Grammar and test program; 

## Grammar 
Grammar is a set of rules that specify what a language should look like and how to interpret. They are stored in 
**/frameQL/grammar**.    
In this directory, you will see **frameQLLexer** and **frameQLParser** that are rules for our language.    
In **/frameQL/grammar/test** is our test program that will take in a query text file and return a list of arguments that can be recognized by EVA video analytic engine, which is being developmented by another team.    

You can read more about it in each of the directories' README.MD
